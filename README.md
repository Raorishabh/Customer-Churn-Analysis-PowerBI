📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard | Power BI  

📌 Project Overview  
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle).  
It provides a detailed analysis of customer retention and churn behavior across different contract types, payment methods, tenure groups, and spending patterns.  

The goal is to enable business stakeholders to:  
- Track overall customer churn and revenue trends  
- Identify high-risk customer segments  
- Understand drivers of customer attrition  
- Support data-driven retention strategies

- KPI Cards: Total Customers, Churned Customers, Churn Rate %, Total Revenue  
- Donut Chart: Churn Distribution by Contract Type
